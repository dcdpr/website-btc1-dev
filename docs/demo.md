DID Method specifications overload the term "CRUD" to describe how to interact
with the key features of the method: Create, Resolve, Update, Deactivate.
The below sections demo how to use each feature of DID Method BTCR2. 

* [Create](#create) - describes the process for creating a new did:btcr2 identifier (DID)
  and a corresponding DID document from a public key or an existing DID document.
* [Resolve](#resolve) - describes the process for resolving a specific did:btcr2 identifier
  using data found in the Bitcoin blockchain.
* [Update](#update) - describes the process for updating a DID document by commiting the
  patch updates to the Bitcoin blockchain for later resolution.
* [Deactivate](#deactivate) - describes the process for deactivating a DID and corresponding
  DID document to discontinue usage.
